        Computer science and engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities which comprises approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field of materials science and engineering.

	As the name suggests, computer science engineering is a study that encompasses the theory of computation and the design and implementation of computational systems. This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees.

As part of the computer science and engineering programme, students learn about developing hardware and software systems for computers and gain ample knowledge of communication systems and other similar devices. This is also one of the reasons why CSE engineering graduates are best suited for robotics research.
